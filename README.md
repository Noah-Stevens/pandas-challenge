Hello, I basically followed Alexander's guide on how to do this HW. 
I tried to change up certain things, but seems pretty difficult to go in a different direction without completely going into alien territory this class hasn't touched on
I did at the end add an extra variable for the type table to show the student number difference between charter and district schools, and some tables I sorted the values when applicable.

Thank you!! :)))
